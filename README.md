Notice that this module **does not require** admin privileges to get the drives in any supported operating system.

Supports:

- Windows.
- GNU/Linux distributions that include [util-linux](https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux) and [udev](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/udev).
- Mac OS X.

The `drivelist` core consists of a set of scripts built with technologies that
are available by default on the target operating systems (like Bash, VBScript,
etc). Each of these scripts attempts to get information about the available
drives (and metadata related to them), using any methods the target platform
provides, like a combination of `diskutil`, `/proc/mounts`, etc. You can find
these scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

The scripts are then expected to print to `stdout` all the drive information
they have gathered in a predefined way, based on the [YAML][yaml] language. The
scripts are expected to output a set of blocks (separated by blank lines), each
representing a drive with a set of key/value pairs. The exact keys that we
expect are constantly changing while we keep improving this module, but you can
see what the currently expected keys are by running the platform script that
corresponds to your operating system.

This is how the raw output looks on my MacBook Pro at the time of this writing:

```sh
$ ./scripts/darwin.sh
device: /dev/disk0
description: "APPLE SSD SM0256G"
size: 251000193024
mountpoints: []
raw: /dev/rdisk0
protected: False
system: True

device: /dev/disk1
description: "Macintosh HD"
size: 249779191808
mountpoints:
  - path: /
raw: /dev/rdisk1
protected: False
system: True
```

Because of the simplicity of this module's design, supporting a new operating
system simply means adding a new script to `scripts/` that gathers drive data
and outputs something similar to the above example. The challenge with this is
that we must ensure all the platform scripts print consistent output.

When the user executes `drivelist.list()`, the module checks the operating
system of the client, and executes the corresponding drive scanning script as a
child process. It then parses the [YAML][yaml] output of the script as an array
of objects, and returns that to the user.

Examples (the output will vary depending on your machine):

```js
const drivelist = require('drivelist');

drivelist.list((error, drives) => {
  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }

  console.log(drives);
});
```
